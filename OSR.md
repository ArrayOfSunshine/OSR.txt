# Intro

  Nothing new. Mostly stolen (but with appreciation) by [☀️].

  ##Acknowledgements

# Tests

  Roll 1d20 and get a result equal to or under a target number - usually a stat - to succeed. This is called a Test.

  Rolling a test with advantage means the player rolls 2d20 and takes the lower, better roll.

  Rolling a test with disadvantage means the player rolls 2d20 and takes the higher, worse roll.

# Risk Dice

Risk Dice represent everything from a characters magical prowess, to the weight of a sack of gold, to the flickering firelight of a torch, to the comings and goings of a dungeon's inhabitants. Risk Dice vary from d12 to d4. Generally, the higher the risk die the better it is for the characters.

When a Risk Die comes up with a value of 1, 2, or 3 it "steps down" and becomes the next smallest die or nothing at all. A result of 3 is a lucky break, but a 1 or 2 can mean additional consequences depending on the situation.

d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > Nothing


# The Referee

The caveat to all rules is "...at the referee's discretion".

# Character Creation

  All characters begin with the following

  - Hit Dice (HD): 1d6
  - Specialization Dice (SD): 0d6
  - Magic Dice (MD): 0d6

  1. Roll for or choose your Race.
  2. Roll 3d6 for each of your Stats in order.
  3. Reroll your race's stat and take the higher number.
  4. Write down in one or two words or roll a Trait (occupation, affiliation, or background).
  5. Roll for or choose two of the following. You may choose or roll the same option twice.

| d6 | Character Creation |
|---| ---|
|1  | Step up your HD.   |
|2  | Write down or roll a Special Ability and gain a Specialization Die.   |
|3  | Write down or roll two Spells and gain a Magic Die.   |
|4  | Gain a Hit Die. |
|5  | Write down in one or two words or roll a Trait (occupation, affiliation, or background). |
|6  |Choose or roll for one Stat, then roll 3d6. Compare the result to the chosen Stat and keep the higher number.  |

  6. Roll your HD for your starting (Don't Get) Hit Points.
  7. Choose or roll for equipment, weapons, and armor.

# Traits

Traits are brief one or two word descriptions that define your character by establishing:

- What your character **does**, or
- What your character **belongs**, or
- Where your character **comes from**

Traits may be invoked by the players or referee to give advantage or disadvantage or allow attempts at otherwise impossible actions at the referee's discretion.

When rolling or choosing Traits the referee may ask a few questions for clarification and world-building, but the details will emerge through play.

# Hit Dice and Combat Training

A character may wield any weapon and wear any armor with a Risk Die of size less than or equal to the size of their Hit Dice (d6, d8, etc).

A character rolls all their Hit Dice to determine their (Don't Get) Hit Points at character creation and upon levelling up.

## Armor

Armor functions as temporary (Don't Get) Hit Points. The first time a character takes damage roll the armor's Risk Die to determine how many points of damage the armor will absorb until the character can rest and readjust the armor.

## Shields

Shields may be sacrificed to negate the damage from any one attack.

# Specialization Dice and Special Abilities

Special abilities are unique and special aspects of a character.

Special Abilities may be used as long as you have Specialization Dice which refresh when the character has a chance to rest. When a Special Ability is invoked, roll the Specialization Dice as Risk Dice.

Special Abilities usually just work without a Test unless the result would be a feat of renown or impossible outright.

# Magic Dice and Spells

Spells are spirits bound by mortal comprehension to scrolls, books, and other prisons; beguiled and enticed into the mind of the caster; then loosed for the caster's benefit.

A character may prepare up to one spell per Magic Die at a time. Preparing spells requires focus, time, and access to the spell but may be rushed by rolling a Magic Die.

A character may roll one or of their Magic Dice in order to cast a prepared spell. Magic Dice are rolled like Risk Dice. The effect of the spell varies with the number of Magic Dice rolled and the roll result. Magic Dice can be invested in some spells to sustain them until the spell is dismissed or dispelled.

Rolling doubles or triples on the Magic Dice while casting a spell result in a Mishap or a Doom respectively.

When a characters Magic Dice steps down to nothing, they lose a prepared spell as their grasp lapses. Magic Dice refresh when a character has a chance to rest.

# Equipment

## Wealth

Wealth comes in five types which can buy differing levels of goods and services and comes with a Risk Die indicating the relative amount.

To buy something make sure it is available, you have at least the appropriate wealth, and roll the Risk Die.

| Wealth | Weapons + Armor | Equipment | Lodging (week) | Services | Coin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Copper   | Simple | Consumables   | Kitchen Floor   | Information from beggar   |      |
|Silver   | Common | Regular Gear  | Common Room  | Armor and shield repairs   |   Copper[d6]  |
|Gold   | Professional    | Quality Gear   | Private Room  | Potions  |    Silver[d6]  |
|Platinum   | Custom   | Exceptional Gear   | Luxury Accommodations  | Spy, champion  |   Gold[d6]  |
|Adamantium   | Artifacts   | Artifacts   | Palace   |   |  Platinum[d6] |

# Combat

## Initiative

At the start of a combat encounter, each player Tests AWR. Those who succeed have seized the initiative and will go first while those who fail have lost the initiative and will go last.

If any characters have the jump on the enemy combatants, they automatically seize the initiative. Likewise, if the enemy combatants have the jump on any characters, those characters automatically lose the initiative.

1. At the top of the round the referee describes the intent of the enemy combatants.
2. The characters that seized the initiative act.
3. The enemy combatants act.
4. The characters that lost the initiative act.

## Actions

Each character can attack, move, run, hide, cast a spell, roar to intimidate, attempt to regain the initiative, or take any other action that would be feasible in a few seconds.

# Rest

## Take a Breather

Characters can take a Breather when they find a brief respite to eat, drink, and restore themselves in an otherwise dangerous situation.

In a Breather a character can consume food (and roll the Risk Die) to choose one:

- Restore one Hit Die of (Don't Get) Hit Points, or
- Describe a narrative injury that temporarily reduces their maximum HP by 1 point per HD, then recover to full (Don't Get) Hit Points.

## Make Camp

Characters can Make Camp when they are sheltered, settled, and out of imminent danger to sleep and recuperate.

While Camped a character can consume food (and roll the Risk Die) to:

- Recover from Narrative Injuries.
- Recover to full (Don't Get) Hit Points.
- Restore all Magic Dice.
- Restore all Specialization Dice

## Go on Furlough

Characters can take a Furlough when they are in a comfortable and safe environment for an extended period of time - usually in a town, hideout, or stronghold.

While on Furlough a character can spend their wealth (and roll the Risk Die) to:

- Level up.
- Recover to full (Don't Get) Hit Points.
- Recover from Narrative Injuries.
- Restore all Magic Dice.
- Restore all Specialization Dice.

# Hirelings


# Danger Die

When the characters make noise or spend time resting in a dungeon or undertake a journey traveling overland, the referee rolls a Danger Die as a Risk Die.

1. an encounter happens immediately.
2. an encounter is imminent.
3. an encounter might happen.

When the Danger Die steps down to nothing, something really big happens and the die reverts to the initial size.

| Die | Dungeon                     | Terrain                   |
| --- | ---                         | ---|
| d12 | Empty, abandoned, clear     | Wastelands, Ocean         |
| d10 | Sparse                      | Woods, Plains, Lake       |
| d8  | Trafficked                  | Hills, Desert, River      |
| d6  | Crowded, lively, dangerous  | Swamp, Mountains, Jungle  |
| d4  |                             |                           |

#Monsters

|Human Bastard | 1d8 | 1d8 | 1d6    | 1d6   |   |
